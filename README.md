# GA WDI-R Gizmo Project 5
# Disneyland Decoded

## The Technology
Disneyland Decoded is built with HTML, Bootstrap, Angular.js, and Rails. 

## The Approach
Disneyland Decoded is an app that connects Annual Passholders and vacation planners. APs can share tips, tricks, or, eventually, answer questions. Vacation planners can use the app to find out the best ways to save time and money or, some day, ask questions.

## The Future
This is the first version of the app. The backend needs to have a many-to-many, rather than one-to-many, relationship in order to have full functionality. Currently, users can only view their own posts, so it's more of a memory keeping app.
